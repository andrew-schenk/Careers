- [ ] Video or in-person interview
- [ ] Technical II
- [ ] Hired


## Step 1: Send in Resume
Hopefully, you have already done this.  If not please email it to careers@linxsystems.com. We use your resume to get an idea of your education, skills, and previous experience.

## Step 2: Technical 1
Don't freak out!  This is not a LeetCode, whiteboarding, examination.  We ask that all applicants complete a short (less than 5 minutes) open ended question.  For starters, this weeds out the resume spammers and saves us time.  Secondly, we'll have another item to talk to you about during the interview.

Please complete the relevant section and email your answer to careers@linxsystems.com
